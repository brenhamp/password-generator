# Password Generator

I have created a password generator that takes user input and creates a random string based on their requirements.

# Features
* Criteria for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
* Password can be 8 to 128 characters long.
* Random number generator ensures that password is as truly random as possible.

The deployed application will be found at brenhamp.github.io/password-generator

Thanks for reading!
